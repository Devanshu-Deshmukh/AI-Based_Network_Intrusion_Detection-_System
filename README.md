#🛡️ AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that uses Machine Learning (Random Forest Algorithm) to detect malicious network activity.
The system analyzes network traffic features and classifies them as Benign or Malicious through an interactive web-based dashboard.

The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction — making it suitable for academic demonstrations and cybersecurity learning.

🎯 Objectives

Detect network intrusions using machine learning

Classify traffic as benign or malicious

Provide real-time prediction through a user-friendly interface

Visualize model performance using metrics and confusion matrix

Simulate network traffic behavior similar to real datasets
